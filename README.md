# Pantry

## The Idea

This app will help you keep track of what food you have in your home - who put it there, when they put it there, how much is left, and some insights about your food use and spending. Users will create a "Pantry", which can be a specific refrigerator, cabinent, shelf, or location that you store food.

## User Stories

Users of Pantry will be able to use the app to perform functions like:

* Create an account to login into the app and view up your saved data or tryout the app with a mock user profile
* Join a household along with your roommates, family members, or co-workers
  * Keep track of multiple Pantries 
* Keep track of your food in your house(s)
  * Add individual items into your Pantry
  * Input information about items like quantity, price, expiration date, etc.
  * Reduce the quantity of an item as you use it, e.g. update a dozen eggs to eleven eggs
  * Remove an item from your Pantry when it is gone
  * View which of your household put the item there and view its cost for proper compensation
* Look at usage history
  * How much money did I spend on food this month?
  * Who ate most of the eggs from this carton?
  * View who drank the last of the milk so you can *kindly* ask them to get more!
